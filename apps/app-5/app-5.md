## Objectives
* Make your fifth app
* Make a non-ambiguous, fully-constrained UI
* Create a UI that remains responsive while fetching data from a server
* Gain autonomy in making apps

This app will have less guided instruction than previous ones; the final app will have even less. This is intended to prepare you for making a final project all by yourself. It's still extremely similar to what we did in class, so it shouldn't be too challenging 

## Topics
* Segues
* TableViews
* NavigationController
* URLSession
* Codable
* Firebase

## Getting Started
* Pick any api from this list of public and free apis: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
* As a note, api's with "OAuth" authentication are significantly harder to work with. You'll get double credit on this app if you choose to do one of these apis (note it when submitting). Double credit = 200/100
* Confirm that you can connect to that API 

## Technical Requirements (Any application that satisfies these criteria will earn you full credit) 
* Connect to your API using URLSession
* Utilize codable to decode data from your chosen API 
* Utilize a segue in some way 
* Utilize a tableview in someway (a very popular way to have both a segue and tableview can be found in your previous app) 
* Link data that you retrieved from the api and store it inside a cloud firestore database; your entire application should still be functional even after your API key expires
